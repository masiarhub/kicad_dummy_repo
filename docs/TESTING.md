# Testing the workflow (Ubuntu 24.04)

Use the template's own schematic as the dummy project: it already has
hierarchical sub-sheets (`Section A`, `Section B` under `Project Architecture`,
`Power - Sequencing` under the root), and `sheet-ownership.conf` maps them.

## 0. Tools

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kicad/kicad-9.0-releases
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y kicad git shellcheck
# GitHub CLI (optional, handy for watching runs)
sudo apt install -y gh && gh auth login
# actionlint (workflow linter)
curl -sSL https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases/download/v1.7.7/actionlint_1.7.7_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  | tar xz actionlint && sudo mv actionlint /usr/local/bin/
```

## 1. Static checks (seconds, before every push of CI changes)

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yaml
shellcheck .github/scripts/check_sheet_ownership.sh
FEATURE_BRANCH=feature/section-a bash .github/scripts/check_sheet_ownership.sh   # on a feature branch
```

## 2. Dummy project from the adjusted template

Don't test in a real project repo. Make a throw-away project from this
template branch and give it its own repo in the org (public = unlimited
Actions minutes and branch rulesets on the Free plan).

```bash
# 2a. Install the adjusted template into KiCad 9's user template folder
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/template && cd ~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/template
git clone -b ci/multi-user-workflow git@github.com:ETHRoboticsClub/KDT_Hierarchical_KiBot.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts && cp -i KDT_Hierarchical_KiBot/kibot_resources/fonts/*.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/ && fc-cache
mkdir -p ~/.config/kicad/9.0/colors && cp -i KDT_Hierarchical_KiBot/kibot_resources/colors/Altium_Theme.json ~/.config/kicad/9.0/colors/
```

2b. In KiCad: **File → New Project From Template → KDT_Hierarchical_KiBot**,
name it e.g. `ci_dummy`, in `~/ci-test/ci_dummy/`. Close KiCad.

2c. KiCad does **not** copy hidden files from a template on Linux. Copy them
yourself, then make it a repo with `main` and `dev`:

```bash
T=~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/template/KDT_Hierarchical_KiBot
cd ~/ci-test/ci_dummy
cp -r "$T/.github" "$T/.gitignore" "$T/.gitattributes" .
cp -rn "$T/docs" .                       # in case KiCad skipped it
ls "Section A - Title A.kicad_sch" "Section B - TItle B.kicad_sch"   # sub-sheets keep their names
rm -rf .git                               # in case KiCad copied the template's history
git init -b main && git add -A && git commit -m "Dummy project from template"
git switch -c dev
# create the empty repo ETHRoboticsClub/kicad-ci-sandbox on GitHub first (no README), then:
git remote add origin git@github.com:ETHRoboticsClub/kicad-ci-sandbox.git
git push -u origin main dev
```

What to check after renaming:

* `.github/sheet-ownership.conf`: the three sub-sheet entries still match (KiCad only renames the root files to `ci_dummy.*`). If you add your own sheets, add a line per feature.
* `.github/CODEOWNERS`: optional for the test; rules are commented out.
* `kibot_yaml/kibot_main.yaml`: `GIT_URL` points to the template repo; set it to the sandbox URL (it only appears in the generated docs).

GitHub settings of the sandbox:

* **Actions → General → Workflow permissions:** "Read and write". If the org forbids it, the dev output commit fails with 403 (T6).
* **Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables:** none needed (defaults: `KIBOT_VARIANT=DRAFT`, `ERC_BLOCKING=false`, `SHEET_GUARD_MODE=fail`).
* **Rules → Rulesets** (later, T8): ruleset on `dev`: require PR, required checks *Sheet ownership guard* and *Schematic check (ERC + PDF artifact)*.

The first push of `dev` already runs CI: wait for the "Update Outputs" commit
before cloning (step 3).

## 3. Simulate two users on one machine

```bash
cd ~/ci-test
git clone git@github.com:ETHRoboticsClub/kicad-ci-sandbox.git alice
git clone git@github.com:ETHRoboticsClub/kicad-ci-sandbox.git bob
git -C alice config user.name Alice && git -C alice config user.email alice@example.org
git -C bob   config user.name Bob   && git -C bob   config user.email bob@example.org
git -C alice switch -c feature/section-a origin/dev && git -C alice push -u origin feature/section-a
git -C bob   switch -c feature/section-b origin/dev && git -C bob   push -u origin feature/section-b
```

Open `alice/ci_dummy.kicad_pro` in KiCad for Alice's edits and
`bob/ci_dummy.kicad_pro` for Bob's. Close KiCad between users. Leave the
original `~/ci-test/ci_dummy` folder alone after step 2 (or delete it), so you
don't push from three places.

## 4. Test cases

| # | Do | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Alice: add a resistor in *Section A*, annotate current sheet only, commit just that file, push | guard ✅, ERC step runs, artifact `schematic-check-N` contains a schematic PDF showing the resistor. **No** commit from CI on `feature/section-a` |
| T2 | Bob (in parallel): same in *Section B*, push | same as T1 |
| T3 | Both open PRs into dev, merge Alice's, then Bob's | Bob's PR merges **without conflicts**. After each merge, a dev run commits "Update Outputs" |
| T4 | Alice: edit *Section B* too, push | guard ❌, annotation on the file name in the run summary |
| T5 | Alice: change a net class (touches `.kicad_pro`), push | guard ❌ (shared file) |
| T6 | After T3: Bob pushes to dev **without** pulling | push rejected (non-fast-forward). `git pull` merges cleanly (only outputs changed), push works |
| T7 | Push two commits to dev 30 s apart | second run waits (concurrency); first run logs "Outputs not pushed … branch moved"; only one "Update Outputs" commit lands |
| T8 | Enable the dev ruleset (require PR) | **Expected failure**: CI can't push "Update Outputs" to dev. Fix: add the bypass actor (or deploy key) for CI, or require PRs only on main. Re-run T3 |
| T9 | Alice and Bob both edit *Project Architecture* (parent sheet) on dev | real Git conflict: demonstrates why parent sheets belong to the integrator |
| T10 | Both annotate with "entire schematic" on their branches, merge | Git merges, ERC on dev reports duplicate references: demonstrates the annotation rule |
| T11 | Set `ERC_BLOCKING=true`, push a feature with an unconnected pin | Schematic check ❌ |
| T12 | PR dev → main, merge, `git tag 0.1.0 && git push origin 0.1.0` | release with assets; `CHANGELOG.md` gets a `0.1.0` section; then `git switch dev && git merge origin/main` |
| T13 | Alice: add `section-a = *.kicad_sch` to `sheet-ownership.conf` on her branch and edit *Section B*, push | guard ❌ for *Section B* and for the conf file (mapping is read from dev) |
| T14 | Alice: run KiBot locally, commit `Schematic/*.pdf`, push | guard ❌ "generated by CI on dev" |
| T15 | Alice and Bob each add a line under *Unreleased → Added* in `CHANGELOG.md` on their branches, merge both PRs | no conflict; both lines present |
| T16 | Push a schematic change to dev, then within the run push a commit that only changes a `.md` file | second push starts no run; first run rebases "Update Outputs" onto it and pushes |
| T17 | Tag a commit that is on dev but not on main, push the tag | generate_outputs ❌ "Tag not on main", nothing pushed to main, no release |

Pass = T1–T7, T11–T17 behave as expected and you understood T8–T10.

## 5. Optional: run KiBot locally (Docker)

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker.io && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   # log out/in once
./kibot_resources/scripts/docker_kibot_linux.sh -v 9
# inside the container:
./kibot_launch.sh -v DRAFT
```

Useful to debug KiBot config errors without waiting for Actions. Don't commit
locally generated outputs; CI owns them.

## 6. Moving to the real project

Once this branch is merged into the template's `main`, new projects get
everything via **New Project From Template** (plus the hidden-file copy in
2c). For an existing project, copy `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
`docs/` into its repo on dev, rewrite `sheet-ownership.conf` and `CODEOWNERS`
for your sheets, push, and re-run T1 and T3 once with real people.
